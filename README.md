üöÄ  Setup Instructions:
1. Clone the project: git clone git@github.com:cahutayxander/Adaca_TodoAPI.git
2. Install Docker Desktop. Laravel Sail runs on Docker, so you need Docker installed on your system.
    - Download Docker Desktop compatible with your machine here https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/
3. Install Composer dependencies using Docker. Navigate to the project root(directory). Go to the directory where you cloned the project ‚Äî this should be the same directory that contains files like composer.json, artisan, and the app/ folder. Then run the command below without (-).
    - docker run --rm -v $(pwd):/app -w /app composer install


‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to run project:
1. Open Docker Desktop
    - Ensure Docker Desktop is running since Laravel Sail containers depend on it.
2. Copy the .env file. Run without (-)
    - cp .env.example .env
3. Start Laravel Sail to boot up the development environment.
    - ./vendor/bin/sail up
4. When you're done, you can stop the running Sail containers with
    - ./vendor/bin/sail stop


‚úÖ How to Verify if the Application is Running
1. Open Postman and click the Import button in the top-left corner.
